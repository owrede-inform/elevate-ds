# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a newly initialized project called "elevate-ds" - likely a design system or component library based on the name. The repository currently contains only a basic README.md file and is in its initial state.

## Current State

- **Project Status**: Empty/initial state - contains only README.md
- **No Build System**: No package.json, build scripts, or dependency management detected
- **No Source Code**: No JavaScript, TypeScript, or other source files present
- **No Testing**: No test framework or test files configured
- **No Documentation**: Only basic README.md exists

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project with no configuration files:

1. **Initialize the project** with the appropriate package manager:
   - `npm init` for Node.js projects
   - `yarn init` for Yarn projects
   - Or setup appropriate build system based on project type

2. **Determine project type** and setup accordingly:
   - React component library
   - Vue component library  
   - Pure CSS/SCSS design system
   - Web Components library
   - Documentation site (Storybook, etc.)

## Next Steps for Development

This project needs foundational setup. Key decisions needed:

1. **Technology Stack**: Choose framework and build tools
2. **Package Management**: npm, yarn, or pnpm
3. **Build System**: Webpack, Vite, Rollup, or other
4. **Testing Framework**: Jest, Vitest, Cypress, etc.
5. **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript config
6. **Documentation**: Storybook, Docusaurus, or similar

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal:
```
elevate-ds/
├── README.md          # Basic project description
└── CLAUDE.md          # This file
```

Future instances should help establish the foundational project structure based on the intended use case of this design system.
