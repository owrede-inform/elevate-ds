# Data Tables

Data tables present structured information in rows and columns, allowing users to scan, compare, and manipulate large datasets efficiently.

## Overview

Well-designed data tables help users quickly find, understand, and act upon tabular data. They should balance information density with readability and provide powerful interaction capabilities.

## When to Use

- **Dataset Display** - Showing structured data with multiple attributes
- **Comparison Tasks** - Enabling side-by-side comparisons
- **Data Management** - Allowing users to edit, sort, and filter data
- **Reporting Interfaces** - Presenting analytical data and metrics

## Core Components

### Table Structure
- **Headers** - Column labels with sorting and filtering controls
- **Data Rows** - Individual records with consistent formatting
- **Selection** - Checkboxes or row selection for bulk actions
- **Actions** - Row-level or bulk actions for data manipulation

### Essential Features
- **Sorting** - Click column headers to sort data
- **Filtering** - Search and filter controls above table
- **Pagination** - Breaking large datasets into manageable pages
- **Selection** - Single or multiple row selection capabilities

## Design Patterns

### Basic Data Table
Simple table with essential features: sorting, basic styling, and responsive behavior.

### Advanced Data Table
Feature-rich table with filtering, search, bulk actions, inline editing, and custom cell renderers.

### Responsive Data Table
Mobile-optimized table that adapts layout and functionality for different screen sizes.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- **Virtual Scrolling** - For tables with hundreds or thousands of rows
- **Progressive Loading** - Load data in chunks as needed
- **Intelligent Caching** - Cache frequently accessed data
- **Debounced Search** - Prevent excessive API calls during typing

### Mobile Considerations
- **Priority Columns** - Show most important columns on mobile
- **Expandable Rows** - Reveal additional details in expanded view
- **Horizontal Scrolling** - Allow scrolling for non-critical columns
- **Card View Option** - Alternative layout for mobile devices

### Accessibility Standards
- **Table Semantics** - Proper table, thead, tbody, th, td elements
- **Header Association** - Associate data cells with appropriate headers
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Screen Reader Support** - Clear table summary and navigation aids

## Interaction Patterns

### Sorting Behavior
- **Visual Indicators** - Clear sort direction arrows
- **Multi-column Sort** - Hold Shift for secondary sorting
- **Default Sort** - Logical default sorting (usually by first column)
- **Sort State Memory** - Remember user preferences

### Filtering Options
- **Global Search** - Search across all table content
- **Column Filters** - Individual column filtering controls
- **Advanced Filters** - Complex filter combinations
- **Filter Persistence** - Maintain filters across page refreshes

### Selection and Actions
- **Row Selection** - Click row or checkbox to select
- **Bulk Actions** - Actions that apply to multiple selected items
- **Inline Actions** - Quick actions available on each row
- **Context Menus** - Right-click or dropdown menus for additional actions

:::tip Table Performance
For large datasets, implement virtual scrolling and server-side pagination to maintain good performance. Consider showing loading states during data fetching operations.
