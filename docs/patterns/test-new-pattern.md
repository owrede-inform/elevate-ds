# Test New Pattern

This file demonstrates how autogenerated sidebars work in Docusaurus.

## Key Benefits

1. **No Manual Updates** - This file will automatically appear in the Patterns sidebar
2. **Graceful Handling** - If you delete this file, it will disappear without crashes
3. **Easy Ordering** - Use `sidebar_position` to control where it appears
4. **Custom Labels** - Use `sidebar_label` to customize the display name

## Testing Instructions

1. Save this file and check the Patterns sidebar - it should appear automatically
2. Delete this file and check again - it should disappear without any errors
3. No need to update `sidebars.ts` manually!

This is exactly what you wanted - easy content management without manual sidebar maintenance.
