# Design Patterns

Design patterns provide proven solutions to common user interface challenges. These patterns help teams build consistent, predictable, and effective user experiences across all INFORM products and applications.

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to recurring design problems. They represent best practices for organizing information, structuring interactions, and creating intuitive user experiences.

**Benefits of Using Patterns:**
- üîÑ **Consistency** - Unified experience across products
- ‚ö° **Efficiency** - Faster design and development
- üéØ **Usability** - Proven interaction models
- üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability** - Tested and validated solutions
- üìö **Knowledge Sharing** - Common vocabulary and understanding

**[Pagination](/docs/patterns/pagination)**
Breaking large datasets into manageable chunks with navigation controls.

**Key Navigation Principles:**
- Clear visual hierarchy and logical organization
- Consistent placement and behavior across pages

Guiding users when no content or data is available.

**Interaction Design Principles:**
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- Clear affordances showing interactive elements
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Accessible interactions for all users
