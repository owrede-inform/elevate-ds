# Primary Navigation

Primary navigation provides the main wayfinding system for applications and websites. It helps users understand where they are, where they can go, and how to get back to important areas.

## Overview

Primary navigation is the most important navigation element on your interface. It should be consistent, accessible, and provide clear paths to key sections of your application.

## When to Use

- **Website Header** - Primary site navigation
- **Dashboard Navigation** - Main sections in dashboard interfaces

## Pattern Variations

### Horizontal Navigation Bar
The most common pattern for desktop interfaces, placed at the top of the page.
