# Card Layouts

Cards are flexible containers that group related information and actions. They provide a convenient way to display content in a structured, scannable format that works well across different screen sizes.

## Overview

Card layouts help organize complex information into digestible chunks. Each card should contain related content and provide clear actions users can take.

## When to Use

- **Content Collections** - Displaying lists of articles, products, or items
- **Dashboard Widgets** - Presenting metrics, charts, or quick actions
- **Feature Showcases** - Highlighting product features or services
- **User Profiles** - Displaying user information and actions

## Design Principles

### Information Hierarchy
- **Primary Content** - Most important information prominently displayed
- **Secondary Details** - Supporting information with appropriate emphasis
- **Actions** - Clear, accessible controls for user interactions
- **Visual Elements** - Images, icons, or charts that support content

### Content Organization
- **Related Grouping** - Keep related information together
- **Consistent Structure** - Use similar layouts across card types
- **Appropriate Density** - Balance information with white space
- **Clear Boundaries** - Distinguish cards from background and each other

## Layout Variations

### Single Column Cards
Ideal for detailed content that needs full width, such as article previews or detailed product information.

### Grid Layout Cards
Perfect for collections of similar items, like product catalogs or team member profiles.

### Mixed Layout Cards
Combining different card sizes for varied content types, such as dashboard widgets or content feeds.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Card Structure
- **Header Area** - Title, category, or primary identifier
- **Content Area** - Main information, description, or media
- **Action Area** - Buttons, links, or interactive elements
- **Footer Area** - Metadata, timestamps, or secondary actions

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile First** - Single column layout for small screens
- **Tablet Adaptation** - 2-3 column grids for medium screens
- **Desktop Enhancement** - Multi-column layouts with hover states
- **Content Adaptation** - Adjust information density by screen size

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Semantic Structure** - Proper heading hierarchy within cards
- **Keyboard Navigation** - All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support** - Meaningful labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management** - Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
