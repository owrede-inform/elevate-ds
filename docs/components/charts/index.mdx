:::info Component Status: Planned
The ELEVATE Charts component is currently in planning and development phase. This documentation demonstrates the intended patterns and functionality for future implementation. The examples shown use existing ELEVATE components combined with SVG and CSS to create chart interfaces.
:::

Charts transform raw data into visual insights that users can quickly understand and act upon. The planned ELEVATE Charts component will help designers and developers create consistent, accessible data visualizations that communicate information clearly and support data-driven decision making.

## Overview

### When to Use Charts
- **Data comparison**: Compare values across categories or time periods
- **Trend visualization**: Show changes and patterns over time
- **Part-to-whole relationships**: Display how individual parts make up a total
- **Performance metrics**: Dashboard KPIs and business intelligence displays
- **Progress tracking**: Show completion status and goal achievement

### When NOT to Use Charts
- **Simple values**: Use text or number displays for single data points
- **Complex tables**: Use Table component for detailed data that needs sorting/filtering
- **Interactive exploration**: Use specialized data visualization tools for complex analysis
- **Real-time streaming**: Consider performance implications for rapidly updating data

## Variations

### Chart Types

**Line Charts** show trends and changes over time, ideal for continuous data visualization.

  code="code-examples/line-chart-pattern.html" />

**Bar Charts** compare discrete categories or values, perfect for rankings and comparisons.

<ComponentShowcase
  title="Bar Chart Pattern"
  description="Categorical data comparison showing sales performance by region"
  code="code-examples/bar-chart-pattern.html" />

**Donut Charts** display part-to-whole relationships with center space for key metrics.

<ComponentShowcase
  title="Donut Chart Pattern"
  description="Part-to-whole visualization showing user distribution across device types"
  code="code-examples/donut-chart-pattern.html" />

**Area Charts** combine line chart benefits with filled areas to show volume and trends.

**Scatter Plots** reveal correlations and relationships between two variables through point positioning.

## Design Principles

### Clarity Principle
**Data should be immediately understandable without interpretation.** Charts should communicate their message within seconds of viewing. Complex or confusing visualizations force users to work harder to extract insights.

### Truthfulness Principle  
**Visual representation should accurately reflect the underlying data.** Misleading scales, truncated axes, or disproportionate visual elements can misrepresent information and lead to incorrect conclusions.

### Progressive Disclosure Principle
**Start with overview, allow drilling down to details.** Users often need both high-level insights and specific data points. Charts should support multiple levels of detail without overwhelming the initial view.

### Context Principle
**Provide sufficient context for data interpretation.** Charts without proper labels, legends, or reference points leave users guessing about meaning and significance.

## Best Practices

### Choosing Appropriate Chart Types

**Why this matters:** Wrong chart types can obscure patterns or create false impressions. Users make decisions based on visual patterns, so the chart type must match the data relationship being communicated.

### Using Color Effectively

**Why this matters:** Color carries meaning in data visualization. Inconsistent or inappropriate color usage can confuse users or make charts inaccessible to users with color vision differences.

### Labeling and Legends

**Why this matters:** Charts without clear labels force users to guess what data represents. Ambiguous or missing labels create cognitive load and reduce user confidence in the information.

## Implementation

### Getting Started

```bash
npm install @inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui
```

```javascript
// Import all components
import '@inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui';

// Or import specific components  
import '@inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui/dist/components/button/button.js';
import '@inform-elevate/elevate-core-ui/dist/components/icon/icon.js';
```

### Common Chart Patterns

Charts can be created using SVG, HTML, CSS, and ELEVATE components for interactive elements:

```html
<!-- Basic line chart structure -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <div class="chart-header">
    <h3>Revenue Trend</h3>
    <elvt-button size="small" tone="subtle">
      <elvt-icon slot="prefix" icon="mdi:download"></elvt-icon>
      Export
    </elvt-button>
  </div>
  
  <div class="chart-area">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 300 150" class="line-chart">
      <!-- Grid lines -->
      <defs>
        <pattern id="grid" width="60" height="30" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
          <path d="M 60 0 L 0 0 0 30" fill="none" stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="0.5"/>
        </pattern>
      </defs>
      <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#grid)" />
      
      <!-- Data line -->
      <polyline fill="none" stroke="#007bff" stroke-width="2" 
                points="20,120 80,100 140,80 200,90 260,70"/>
      
      <!-- Data points -->
      <circle cx="20" cy="120" r="3" fill="#007bff"/>
      <circle cx="80" cy="100" r="3" fill="#007bff"/>
      <!-- ... more points ... -->
    </svg>
  </div>
  
  <div class="chart-summary">
    <div class="metric">
      <div class="value">+15%</div>
      <div class="label">Growth</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Key Components Used

Components commonly used to create chart interfaces:

| Component | Usage | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `elvt-button` | Chart actions, filters | Interactive buttons for export, filter, and control actions |
| `elvt-icon` | Visual indicators | MDI icons for chart controls and status indicators |  
| SVG Elements | Chart graphics | Scalable vector graphics for lines, bars, and shapes |
| HTML/CSS | Layout structure | Containers, legends, labels, and responsive styling |
| CSS Gradients | Visual enhancement | Color gradients for bars and visual appeal |

*For complete examples and styling patterns, see the ComponentShowcase demonstrations above.*

## Interactive Examples

### Dashboard Analytics Pattern

  code="code-examples/analytics-dashboard-with-multiple-charts.html" />

## Accessibility

### Essential Accessibility Practices

**Provide alternative data representations:**
- Include data tables as alternatives to visual charts
- Offer text summaries of key insights
- Consider sonification for screen reader users

**Use sufficient color contrast:**
- Chart elements must meet 3:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Include patterns or textures alongside color coding

**Keyboard navigation support:**
- Interactive chart elements should be keyboard accessible
- Provide focus indicators for interactive data points
- Enable data exploration without mouse interaction

**Screen reader compatibility:**
- Use ARIA labels to describe chart content
- Provide structured markup for data relationships
- Include alt text that summarizes chart insights

## Development Status

:::note Coming Soon
The elvt-charts component is planned for a future release. Current implementation uses combinations of existing ELEVATE components (elvt-button, elvt-icon) with SVG elements for chart visualization. 

**Planned Features:**
- Native chart components for line, bar, donut, and area charts
- Built-in accessibility features and ARIA support
- Interactive data point selection and tooltip display
- Responsive and mobile-optimized layouts
- Integration with data binding and animation systems

Stay tuned for updates on the development timeline.
