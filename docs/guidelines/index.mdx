# Guidelines

Guidelines provide the foundational principles and best practices for creating exceptional user experiences with the ELEVATE Design System. These standards ensure consistency, accessibility, and effectiveness across all INFORM products and applications.

## Core Design Principles

### Consistency
**Create predictable experiences that users can trust**

- Use established patterns and components across all interfaces
- Maintain visual hierarchy through consistent spacing and typography
- Apply design tokens systematically for colors, spacing, and typography
- Follow established interaction patterns for similar use cases

### Clarity
**Make information clear and easy to understand**

- Use plain language and avoid jargon
- Structure information with clear visual hierarchy
- Provide sufficient context for user actions
- Use progressive disclosure to manage complexity

### Accessibility
**Design for everyone, regardless of ability or circumstance**

- Meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Provide multiple ways to access information and functionality
- Use sufficient color contrast and readable typography
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Efficiency
**Enable users to accomplish their goals quickly and effectively**

- Minimize cognitive load and decision fatigue
- Provide shortcuts for expert users
- Use smart defaults and reduce form complexity
- Optimize for common user workflows

### Inclusivity
**Create experiences that work for diverse users and contexts**

- Consider different cultural contexts and languages
- Support various devices, screen sizes, and input methods
- Design for different levels of technical expertise
- Account for varying internet connectivity and performance

- Privacy and data considerations

## Implementation Standards

### Quality Assurance

#### Design Review Checklist
- [ ] **Consistency** - Follows established patterns and uses design tokens
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] **Responsiveness** - Works across different screen sizes and devices
- [ ] **Performance** - Optimized for loading speed and interaction responsiveness
- [ ] **Usability** - Clear information hierarchy and intuitive interactions

#### Testing Requirements
- **Accessibility Testing** - Screen reader, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- **Cross-Browser Testing** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Device Testing** - Mobile, tablet, desktop responsiveness
- **Performance Testing** - Loading times, interaction responsiveness
- **User Testing** - Validation with real users and use cases

### Documentation Standards

#### Component Documentation
Every component should include:
- **Usage Guidelines** - When and how to use the component
- **Best Practices** - Recommended implementation patterns
- **Accessibility Notes** - Specific accessibility considerations
- **Examples** - Code examples and live demonstrations
- **API Reference** - Complete property and method documentation

#### Pattern Documentation
Design patterns should include:
- **Problem Statement** - What problem does this pattern solve
- **Solution Overview** - How the pattern addresses the problem
- **Implementation Guide** - Step-by-step implementation instructions
- **Variations** - Different ways to apply the pattern
- **Related Patterns** - Connections to other design patterns

## Governance and Evolution

### Design System Governance

#### Decision Making Process
1. **Proposal** - Submit new component or pattern proposals
2. **Review** - Design system team evaluates against principles
3. **Community Input** - Gather feedback from implementing teams
4. **Testing** - Prototype and validate with users
5. **Documentation** - Create comprehensive usage guidelines
6. **Release** - Integrate into design system with proper versioning

#### Contribution Guidelines
- **Open Collaboration** - All teams can propose improvements
- **Evidence-Based** - Decisions backed by user research and data
- **Backward Compatibility** - Changes maintain existing implementations
- **Documentation First** - All changes include updated documentation
- **Community Review** - Public review period for major changes

### Continuous Improvement

#### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Usage Analytics** - Monitor component adoption and usage patterns
- **User Research** - Regular usability testing and user interviews
- **Team Feedback** - Structured feedback collection from implementing teams
- **Support Requests** - Analysis of common issues and questions
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track technical performance metrics

#### Evolution Process
- **Regular Audits** - Quarterly review of design system effectiveness
- **Version Planning** - Roadmap planning with community input
- **Deprecation Policy** - Clear communication about component lifecycle
- **Migration Support** - Tools and guidance for version upgrades
- **Training Programs** - Ongoing education for design system users
