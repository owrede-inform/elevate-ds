### Semantic Versioning

ELEVATE follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:

#### Beta Releases (0.x.x-beta)
- **Purpose**: Feature-complete previews before stable release
- **Stability**: Feature-frozen, API stable, bug fixes only
- **Audience**: Production-ready early adopters
- **Frequency**: 1-2 weeks before stable release

#### Stable Releases (1.x.x)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready releases
